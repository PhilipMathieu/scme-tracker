L.D. 1065 (S.P. 438): An Act Regarding the Reduction and Recycling of Food Waste ,Watching,,Introduced or Prefiled,,2025-03-12,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1065?legislature=132,"The legislative text outlines a comprehensive framework aimed at reducing and recycling food waste in Maine. The primary provisions mandate that, starting July 1, 2027, designated food waste generators are prohibited from disposing of food waste in incineration facilities or landfills. Instead, they must reduce food waste volume, donate excess edible food, and manage remaining waste through agricultural use, composting, or anaerobic digestion. The legislation defines a designated food waste generator based on the average weekly food waste produced and its proximity to an organics recycler. Initially, from July 1, 2027, to June 30, 2029, this applies to entities generating two or more tons of food waste weekly within 20 miles of a recycler. From July 1, 2029, the threshold lowers to one ton per week within 25 miles. By July 1, 2032, the Department of Environmental Protection may extend these criteria to include those generating less than one ton but more than 100 pounds weekly or located farther than 25 miles from a recycler. The bill also allows for temporary hardship waivers of up to three years if compliance causes undue hardship. Additionally, the legislation revises the state's food recovery hierarchy, emphasizing the reduction, donation, and recycling of food waste, and clarifies the state’s waste disposal reduction goals. The Department of Environmental Protection is tasked with administering these requirements, including publishing a list of authorized organics recyclers and food rescue organizations by July 1, 2026.",ME Sen.

Should the original owners or their successors decline to repurchase the land within one year of the bill's enactment, the Maine Turnpike Authority is required to transfer the property to the municipality where it is located at no cost. If the municipality does not wish to retain the property, it must donate it to a local land trust.

The primary objective of the legislation is to lower electricity costs by repealing existing laws that allow the Public Utilities Commission to establish and regulate net energy billing programs. This includes the repeal of several sections within Title 35-A, which previously facilitated net energy billing for commercial and institutional customers of investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities. The legislation also introduces a prohibition against the commission requiring utilities to permit customer participation in net energy billing. Additionally, the bill modifies existing statutes by removing references to net energy billing, including the repeal of property tax exemptions for solar energy equipment associated with net energy billing customers. The amendments specify that solar energy equipment must use all generated energy on-site to qualify for tax exemptions, eliminating previous provisions that allowed for off-site energy use or utility bill credits. The legislation sets a significant date of April 1, 2025, for the commencement of property tax years affected by these changes.

If PFAS contamination is detected, a third-party analysis is required to determine if the development is the source. The results, along with any third-party analysis, must be documented and submitted to the Department. The Department will evaluate the findings and issue a written determination on whether the contamination was caused by the development's construction, operation, or components. If the Department concludes that the development is responsible for the contamination, the development will lose its eligibility as a renewable resource or renewable capacity resource for energy procurement and contracting purposes, as well as its eligibility for participation in state net energy billing programs.
