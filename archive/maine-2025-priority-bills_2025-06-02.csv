"L.D. 65 (H.P. 29): An Act to Update the Definition of ""Coastal Wetlands"" Under the Natural Resources Protection Act and the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Laws ",Support,"Climate Change: Prevention & Reaction, Coastal Protection",Enacted,,Signed By The Governor,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/65?legislature=132,"This legislative act updates the definition of 'coastal wetlands' under Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act and the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Laws. Specifically, it repeals and replaces the previous statutory definitions in 38 MRSA ยง436-A, sub-ยง1 and 38 MRSA ยง480-B, sub-ยง2. The new definition clarifies that 'coastal wetlands' include all areas with salt-tolerant vegetation found primarily in saltwater or estuarine habitats, as well as all tidal and subtidal lands, and any contiguous lowland such as swamps, marshes, bogs, beaches, or flats subject to tidal action during the highest astronomical tide, as determined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The definition also allows for the inclusion of portions of coastal sand dunes. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are mentioned in the text. This change aligns with the organization's mission to protect and manage Maine's coastal environments by providing a clearer and more comprehensive legal definition, which may enhance regulatory consistency and environmental protection efforts.","ME Rep.

Specifically, the PUC must report after issuing findings in Docket No. 2024-00231 and before starting any formal proceedings to set TOU rates, detailing how it will assess the potential effects of such rates on vulnerable residential customers. The amendment mandates that, during any adjudicatory process to establish TOU rates under Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3212, the PUC must consider and seek to avoid negative impacts on residential customers who rely on life support systems, those receiving medical assistance through specific utility programs, senior citizens, and economically vulnerable individuals. These changes ensure that the interests of at-risk populations are explicitly considered in the development of TOU pricing policies, aligning with the organization's mission to protect vulnerable utility customers.","ME Rep.

L.D. 228 (H.P. 151): An Act to Allow Coastal Seawalls to Be Raised by up to 2 Feet in Order to Accommodate Predicted Sea Level Rise ,Support,,Enacted,,Signed By The Governor (Emergency Measure),https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/228?legislature=132,"This legislation, enacted as an emergency measure, amends Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act to allow for a one-time increase in the height of existing seawalls or similar structures in coastal sand dune systems by up to two feet, in response to recent severe storm events and projected sea level rise. The law specifies that only seawalls legally existing as of January 1, 2025, are eligible, and sets out detailed conditions for eligibility based on property type, proximity to structures, and the absence of restorable sand dunes seaward of the seawall. The height increase cannot exceed one foot above the base flood elevation, and the seawall's other dimensions must remain unchanged. Applicants must mitigate any increased erosion or scouring caused by the height increase, and, where space allows, must construct or enhance sand dunes or vegetative buffers landward of the seawall. For projects involving multiple contiguous lots, the law requires that the height increase not worsen flood risks for neighboring properties. The legislation also clarifies that certain stabilization materials and construction methods are permitted for projects on or landward of existing seawalls, and allows for the replacement of seawalls with increased height under the new provisions. These changes are intended to enhance the resilience of Maine's coastal infrastructure to climate change impacts while maintaining environmental protections for sand dune systems and native vegetation.","ME Rep.

The amendment clarifies that the collection of impact fees may require local governments to expand or modify activities, potentially leading to additional local expenditures. However, the minority of the committee believes that this does not constitute a mandate, as many municipalities already collect similar fees and the legislation does not require new infrastructure. The impact fees collected are proposed to be distributed equally between supporting harbor and sea level rise mitigation infrastructure and public transit infrastructure, which can help offset any costs incurred by municipalities.

The primary objective of the legislation is to facilitate the landfilling of additional sludge amounts by providing more sludge bulking and stabilization material. This is achieved by extending the temporary allowance for the disposal or placement of oversized bulky waste in state-owned landfills. The legislation modifies the existing law by extending the period during which excess residue from solid waste processing facilities can be considered as waste generated within the state from July 1, 2025, to July 1, 2028. It also removes the provision that any other excess residue generated by the facility in a 12-month period is not considered waste generated within the state. Furthermore, the legislation specifies that excess residue associated with the processing of oversized bulky waste used as alternative daily cover is deemed to be waste generated within the state. The changes introduced by this legislation are applied retroactively to June 23, 2023, and are deemed necessary for the preservation of public peace, health, and safety, thus taking effect immediately upon approval.","ME Rep.

This adjustment aims to enhance the efficiency of waste management by emphasizing processes that minimize the need for land disposal. The revised hierarchy now places waste processing, including incineration, immediately after waste reuse and before recycling, thereby promoting a more integrated and effective approach to managing both locally generated and imported solid waste.
