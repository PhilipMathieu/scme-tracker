L.D. 1065 (S.P. 438): An Act Regarding the Reduction and Recycling of Food Waste ,Support,,Enacted,,Governor Action: Unsigned,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1065?legislature=132,"This legislation, enacted as Maine Public Law Chapter 419, establishes a comprehensive framework for the reduction and recycling of food waste in the state. It amends and expands definitions related to food waste, including terms such as 'anaerobic digestion,' 'composting,' 'excess edible food,' and 'food rescue organization.' The law revises the state's solid waste management hierarchy to prioritize food waste reduction at the point of generation, donation of excess edible food to food rescue organizations, diversion for agricultural use, composting or anaerobic digestion (with a preference for subsequent soil application), and, as a last resort, land disposal or incineration. The law sets a statewide goal to reduce per capita municipal solid waste disposal by 5% every five years, using 2014 as a baseline, and encourages resource consumption reduction, waste minimization, and increased reuse. A new section, §2147, introduces phased requirements for 'designated food waste generators'—entities producing significant quantities of food waste at a single location. Starting July 1, 2030, those generating two or more tons per week within 20 miles of an organics recycler must divert food waste from landfills and incinerators, reduce waste generation, donate excess edible food, and transfer remaining food waste to organics recyclers according to a specified priority order. These requirements expand in 2032 to include generators of one or more tons per week within 25 miles, and may be further broadened after July 1, 2035, subject to rulemaking. The law provides for temporary hardship waivers, annual reporting requirements beginning in 2031, and mandates the Department of Environmental Protection to maintain a public list of organics recyclers and food rescue organizations by July 1, 2029. The legislation aligns with environmental and food security goals by promoting food waste reduction, supporting food donation, and encouraging sustainable waste management practices.",ME Sen.

The amendment clarifies that, for any 12-month period ending before July 1, 2026, certain calculations regarding waste residue apply, and introduces new provisions for the period from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027. Specifically, during this latter period, up to 12,500 tons of residue composed of oversized bulky waste disposed of in a state-owned landfill may be classified as waste generated within the state, as defined by Title 38, Section 1303-C, Subsection 40-A. Additionally, for periods ending before July 1, 2026, up to 75,000 tons of additional excess residue (not composed of oversized bulky waste) used as daily cover in state-owned landfills may also be considered in-state waste, while for the period from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027, this cap is set at 37,500 tons. The amendment also updates statutory references to reflect these changes and provides for one-time allocations of $150,000 in fiscal year 2025-26 and $75,000 in 2026-27 from tipping fee revenues to the Department of Environmental Protection for remediation and waste management.

First, it redefines 'parking agreement' to mean a legally binding arrangement between a property developer and the owner of an off-site parking facility, specifying that required parking spaces must be located within 0.25 miles of the development site. The amendment also removes a previous provision that would have prohibited municipalities from requiring developers to provide off-street parking within 0.25 miles of a transit stop, thereby allowing municipalities to maintain such requirements if they choose. Additionally, the amendment shifts the authority for rulemaking from the previously designated entity to the Maine Office of Community Affairs, granting it the power to adopt routine technical rules to administer and enforce the section.

First, it prohibits the Maine Department of Transportation from removing any portion of the specified railroad tracks if there is a pending request for proposals (RFP) from a train company or any other commercial enterprise seeking to use that section of track. Second, the amendment bars the Department from using state-provided funds or proceeds from state-issued bonds to finance the removal of these railroad tracks. These provisions modify the original resolve and committee amendment by adding protections for potential commercial rail use and by restricting the use of public funds for track removal.

L.D. 1423 (S.P. 579): An Act to Improve Recycling by Updating the Stewardship Program for Packaging,Support,,Enacted,,Final Disposition: Enacted,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0579?legislature=132,"This legislative amendment to Maine's stewardship program for packaging materials introduces several significant changes to the existing law (38 MRSA §2146). It revises and clarifies key definitions, including 'consumer,' 'packaging material,' 'post-consumer recycled material,' 'producer,' and 'toxicity.' Notably, the definition of 'packaging material' is expanded to exclude packaging associated with certain federally regulated products, such as drugs, medical devices, biologics, and products regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as well as specific nutritional supplements and medical foods. The amendment also refines the definition of 'producer' to clarify responsibility in various sales scenarios, including internet-based transactions, franchises, and cases where responsibility is contractually assigned to another party. Nonprofit organizations exempt under federal tax law are excluded from the definition of 'producer.'

The bill modifies producer exemption criteria, particularly for those dealing with perishable foods. Producers are now exempt from stewardship requirements for the first 15 tons of packaging material used for perishable food products sold or distributed in Maine during the previous calendar year. The definition of 'perishable food' is clarified to include fresh and processed meats, poultry, seafood, dairy, bakery products, eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables, but excludes most frozen foods except for frozen wild blueberries. Producers must provide documentation to the Department of Environmental Protection within 30 days if claiming an exemption.

The amendment enhances the requirements for the statewide recycling needs assessment, mandating that the stewardship organization evaluate the producer payment schedule's effectiveness in incentivizing the use of readily recyclable packaging and supporting Maine's solid waste management hierarchy. Following the execution of a contract with the Department of Environmental Protection, the stewardship organization may recommend changes to the payment schedule to further these goals, and the department may initiate rulemaking to implement such modifications.

Reporting and compliance provisions are also updated. The stewardship organization and the department must now provide and publish lists of compliant and non-compliant producers and brands, rather than relying solely on product UPCs. Producers are not required to report packaging material data using UPCs. Additionally, producers are protected from increased fees or penalties for not using post-consumer recycled material in packaging if such use is prohibited by state or federal law. Municipalities participating in the stewardship program are required to provide for the collection and recycling of any readily recyclable packaging material generated within their jurisdiction.

Overall, these changes aim to clarify responsibilities, streamline exemptions, and better align the stewardship program with Maine's recycling and waste management objectives, while ensuring compliance with federal regulations and providing flexibility for producers and municipalities.",ME Sen.

L.D. 1868 (S.P. 738): An Act to Advance a Clean Energy Economy by Updating Renewable and Clean Resource Procurement Laws ,Watching,,Enacted,,Governor Action: Signed,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1868?legislature=132,"This legislation, enacted in Maine as Public Law Chapter 386, updates the state's renewable and clean energy procurement laws to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. The law amends Title 35-A of the Maine Revised Statutes to set new portfolio standards and definitions for renewable and 'clean' energy resources, introducing 'Class III' (clean) resources, which include certain nuclear and hydroelectric sources, as well as other low-emission generators certified by the Department of Environmental Protection and the Governor's Energy Office. By 2040, the law requires that 90% of Maine's retail electricity sales come from renewable resources and 10% from clean resources, advancing the previous 100% renewable target from 2050 to a more nuanced 2040 split. The legislation establishes a phased schedule for increasing the required percentage of Class IA (renewable) and Class III (clean) resources in electricity providers' portfolios, with annual benchmarks from 2025 through 2040. It also creates a system of 'clean energy credits' analogous to renewable energy credits, allowing for trading and compliance flexibility, and sets an alternative compliance payment mechanism with a maximum rate of $50 for most classes. The law provides for exemptions for existing contracts, mechanisms for suspending or adjusting scheduled increases if market conditions warrant, and mandates regular reporting to the legislature on progress and impacts. It also enhances consumer information requirements, ensures that financial assistance from compliance payments supports low-income households, and authorizes regional coordination for procurement if it benefits ratepayers. The legislation aligns with Maine's climate and energy goals by diversifying the eligible resource mix, strengthening compliance and reporting frameworks, and supporting consumer and low-income protections.",ME Sen.

The district is created to assume ownership, maintenance, and operation of the dam on Alamoosook Lake, following a petition by the current dam owner for release of ownership under Maine law (Title 38, chapter 5, subchapter 1, article 6). The district will also coordinate water level management and undertake watershed improvement activities, such as fish passage enhancements, water quality monitoring, and invasive species control. The district’s governance will be managed by a five-member board of trustees, with three appointed by the Town of Orland and two elected by waterfront property owners, ensuring representation from both the municipality and local stakeholders. Trustees serve staggered terms, and the board is responsible for financial management, public communications, and policy development for the watershed. Funding for the district’s operations will be split evenly: 50% from the Town of Orland (subject to annual voter approval) and 50% from assessments on waterfront property owners, calculated based on shoreline frontage (capped at 300 feet per property). If the town fails to appropriate its share, the shortfall is covered by increased assessments on property owners. The district is exempt from local taxation, qualifies for grants and loans as a municipality, and is eligible for state agency assistance. The Act includes provisions for public budget hearings, annual budget approval processes, and mechanisms for the Town of Orland to withdraw from the district or for the district to dissolve.

The amendment introduces clear definitions for 'critical terrestrial habitat,' 'significant vernal pool habitat,' and 'significant vernal pool protection zone.' Specifically, it defines the protection zone as the area within 100 feet of the high-water mark of a significant vernal pool and mandates that, to the greatest extent practicable, no disturbance should occur within both the vernal pool depression and this protection zone. The amendment also modifies existing law by removing a previous exemption that allowed landowners to avoid regulation if the vernal pool depression was not on their property. Now, if the critical terrestrial habitat of a significant vernal pool crosses property boundaries, all affected properties must receive equal habitat protections, regardless of whether the vernal pool depression itself is present on a given parcel. Additionally, the amendment establishes criteria for determining when a vernal pool is not considered significant based on its drying period: in northern Maine, if the pool dries out before July 15th, and in southern Maine, before July 1st, it may be deemed not significant by either the Department of Environmental Protection or the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.

The amendment makes several technical corrections to the original bill, including clarifying departmental references and relettering sections for consistency. A significant policy change introduced by the amendment is the restriction placed on the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, who is now prohibited from adopting rules to protect plants under the relevant subchapter unless such action is necessary for the conservation of rare, threatened, or endangered fish or wildlife. This narrows the scope of plant protection to cases directly impacting animal conservation, potentially limiting broader plant conservation efforts. Additionally, the amendment removes a provision that would have required a duplicative consistency review of comprehensive municipal growth management plans by the DIFW, streamlining administrative processes and avoiding redundancy.

The amendment mandates that by January 15, 2027, the DIFW must submit a report to the Legislature's relevant committees detailing the outcomes, findings, and recommendations regarding the transfer of the Natural Areas Program. This report may inform future legislative action, as the committees are authorized to propose related legislation to the 133rd Legislature in 2027. This timeline ensures legislative oversight and the opportunity for further adjustments based on the program's performance post-transfer.

In terms of funding, the amendment details the transfer of personnel and associated funds from the DACF to the DIFW. Specifically, it reallocates one Public Service Manager II, one Resource Management Coordinator, and five Biologist II positions, along with their respective funding streams, from the DACF's Natural Areas Program to the DIFW's Resource Management Services. The financial adjustments for fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27 are outlined, with reductions in the DACF's budget and corresponding increases in the DIFW's budget across the General Fund, Federal Expenditures Fund, and Other Special Revenue Funds. The amendment also establishes a baseline allocation for the Natural Areas Conservation Fund within the DIFW.

Key points relevant to conservation and natural resource management include the administrative realignment of the Natural Areas Program, the narrowed regulatory authority over plant protection, and the requirement for legislative review of the program's transfer. These changes align with the organization's mission if it is focused on efficient government operations and the integration of wildlife and natural area management, but may raise concerns for those prioritizing comprehensive plant conservation, as the amendment limits regulatory protections for plants unless tied to animal conservation needs.

Overall, the amendment seeks to streamline the administration of Maine's natural areas by consolidating programs under the DIFW, clarifies regulatory authority, and ensures legislative oversight, while also making significant changes to the scope of plant protection and the allocation of state resources.","ME Rep.

The definition also allows for the inclusion of portions of coastal sand dunes as coastal wetlands. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are mentioned in the amendment. The primary impact of this legislation is to provide a more precise and consistent legal framework for identifying and regulating coastal wetlands, which is directly relevant to organizations focused on environmental protection, coastal management, and habitat conservation.

The increased height must not exceed one foot above the base flood elevation, and the seawall's other dimensions cannot be altered. Applicants are required to mitigate any increased erosion or scouring caused by the height increase, and, where space allows, must construct or plant native dune vegetation landward of the seawall. For projects involving multiple contiguous lots, the amendment stipulates that the cumulative effect of seawall height increases must not exacerbate flood risks to neighboring properties as determined by engineering analysis. The amendment also clarifies that certain stabilization materials and construction methods are permissible when used in conjunction with existing seawalls, and it allows for the use of metal stakes, anchors, or cables in these contexts under a permit by rule. Additionally, the bill modifies existing law to permit the replacement of seawalls destroyed or threatened by emergencies to be rebuilt with an increased height, in line with the new provisions.

Instead, it clarifies that the compensation fee program must fund conservation projects to offset the conversion of undeveloped land for renewable energy development. The compensation fees are intended to address all requirements for off-site habitat improvements or preservation, with explicit exceptions for habitats associated with rare, threatened, or endangered species; high and moderate value deer wintering areas; significant vernal pool habitats; high and moderate value waterfowl and wading bird habitats; and any other habitats classified as significant wildlife habitat under existing law. The amendment also stipulates that conservation projects funded by these fees must be located within the same biophysical region as the impacted development, unless otherwise approved by the DEP, and must involve habitat comparable to that affected by the project. The department is required to base its approval of conservation projects on the management priorities for the relevant biophysical region.

L.D. 257 (S.P. 124): An Act to Eliminate the Practice of Net Energy Billing,Oppose,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Ought Not To Pass Pursuant To Joint Rule 310,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0124?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 257, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature, proposes the complete elimination of net energy billing (NEB) in the state. The bill repeals several sections of Maine law (notably 35-A MRSA §§3209-A, 3209-B, 3209-C, 3209-E, and related provisions) that previously authorized and regulated NEB programs, which allowed customers generating renewable electricity (such as from solar panels) to receive credits on their utility bills for excess energy supplied to the grid. The legislation explicitly prohibits the Public Utilities Commission from requiring transmission and distribution utilities to offer NEB to customers, effectively ending the practice statewide. Additionally, the bill amends property tax statutes (36 MRSA §§655 and 656) to remove exemptions for solar energy equipment that is used in conjunction with NEB, limiting such exemptions only to equipment where all generated energy is used on-site. The bill also makes conforming changes to other statutes to remove references to NEB and repeals related sales tax exemptions. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are included in the bill, but the changes would take effect for property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2025. The key impact of this legislation is the cessation of state support for NEB, which may affect the financial incentives for residential, commercial, and institutional customers to invest in distributed renewable energy generation. This aligns with a policy shift away from NEB as a mechanism for promoting distributed renewable energy, potentially impacting organizations focused on renewable energy deployment, energy equity, and climate action in Maine.",,
L.D. 32 (S.P. 49): An Act to Repeal the Laws Regarding Net Energy Billing,Oppose,,Introduced or Prefiled,,"Carried Over, In The Same Posture, To Any Special Or Regular Session Of The 132Nd Legislature, Pursuant To Joint Order Sp 800.",https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0049?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 32, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature, proposes a comprehensive repeal of all state laws and regulations related to net energy billing (NEB). The bill eliminates the authority of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish or enforce NEB programs, which previously allowed utility customers to receive bill credits for electricity generated by their own or shared renewable energy systems, such as solar panels. Specifically, the bill repeals Title 35-A, sections 3209-A, 3209-B, 3209-C, 3209-D (in part), and 3209-E, which collectively governed the structure, eligibility, and operation of NEB for both residential and commercial customers. It also enacts a new section, 3209-F, explicitly prohibiting the PUC from requiring utilities to offer NEB to customers, thereby ending the practice statewide.

The legislation further amends related statutes to remove references to NEB, including those affecting property and real estate tax exemptions for solar energy equipment. Under the revised law, only solar energy equipment that uses all generated energy on-site will remain eligible for certain tax exemptions, eliminating benefits for systems participating in NEB or transmitting energy through utility infrastructure for off-site crediting. Additionally, the bill repeals a sales tax exemption for certain renewable energy equipment and makes technical changes to ensure consistency across Maine statutes by deleting or amending provisions that previously referenced NEB programs.

No specific funding allocations or financial figures are included in the bill, as its primary focus is regulatory repeal and statutory amendment rather than appropriations. The bill does not establish new deadlines for compliance but sets the effective date for tax-related changes to property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2025. This timeline ensures that property owners and municipalities have clarity regarding the eligibility of solar energy equipment for tax exemptions in future tax years.

The key points of the bill are the full repeal of NEB programs, the prohibition of future NEB requirements by the PUC, and the narrowing of tax benefits to on-site solar energy use only. These changes significantly impact Maine's renewable energy landscape, particularly for organizations and individuals who have invested in or advocated for distributed solar and community energy projects. The bill aligns with a policy shift away from incentivizing customer-owned or shared renewable generation through utility bill credits, potentially affecting the growth of distributed renewable energy and related economic and environmental benefits in the state.

For organizations focused on advancing renewable energy access, distributed generation, and climate action, this legislation represents a substantial rollback of supportive policies. It may hinder efforts to expand solar adoption, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote energy equity, as NEB has been a key mechanism for enabling broader participation in clean energy generation.",ME Sen.

L.D. 1262 (H.P. 837): An Act to Improve Government Transparency and Accountability by Establishing a Process to Allow a Person to Require the State to Enforce Certain Laws and Rules,Support,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Ought Not To Pass Pursuant To Joint Rule 310,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0837?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 1262, titled 'An Act to Improve Government Transparency and Accountability by Establishing a Process to Allow a Person to Require the State to Enforce Certain Laws and Rules,' proposes several amendments to the Maine Administrative Procedure Act. The bill introduces a formal process allowing individuals to petition state agencies or the Attorney General to enforce existing laws or rules, specifically those related to the environment, natural resources, public health or safety, and government transparency. Agencies or the Attorney General must respond to such petitions within 60 days, either by initiating enforcement proceedings or providing a written denial with reasons; failure to do so enables the petitioner to seek judicial review. The legislation also amends existing statutes to clarify that adjudicatory proceedings initiated under this new process are subject to the same procedural rules as other agency proceedings, with certain exceptions for specific boards and correctional facilities.

A significant feature of the bill is the establishment of the Fund for Administrative Oversight within the Office of the Attorney General. This non-lapsing, dedicated fund is administered by an appointee of the Governor and is designed to support individuals who petition for rulemaking, enforcement, or participation in agency proceedings, particularly those not representing commercial or regulated entities and whose interests focus on environmental protection, public health, safety, or government transparency. The fund can receive revenue from various sources, including legislative appropriations, grants, and contributions. Distribution of funds prioritizes individuals or groups whose interests are not otherwise adequately represented and who are primarily concerned with the public interest areas outlined above. The administrator is also tasked with public education about the fund’s availability.

To finance the fund, the bill directs the Office of the Attorney General to collaborate with relevant state agencies to develop a mechanism for imposing additional fees on licenses, permits, or approvals related to regulated activities in the bill’s focus areas. These fees must be reasonable, not unduly burdensome, and reflect the cost of agency oversight and potential corrective actions. By January 1, 2026, the Attorney General’s office must report recommendations and proposed legislation for these fees to the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government, with the intent that fee collection begins July 1, 2026. The collected fees are to be split evenly, with half retained by the agency for oversight and enforcement and half transferred to the Fund for Administrative Oversight.

The bill’s key points align with the mission of organizations focused on government transparency, environmental protection, and public health advocacy. It enhances public participation in government oversight, provides financial support for non-commercial actors to engage in regulatory processes, and seeks to ensure that state agencies are held accountable for enforcing laws and rules in critical public interest areas. The establishment of a dedicated fund and a clear petition process, along with judicial review rights, are designed to empower individuals and organizations to promote transparency and accountability in state governance.

In summary, this legislation creates new avenues for public enforcement of state laws and rules, establishes a funding mechanism to support such civic engagement, and sets forth a timeline for implementing related fee structures, all with the goal of improving transparency, accountability, and public participation in Maine’s regulatory processes.",ME Rep.

It modifies the requirements for tax incentives by reducing the minimum number of EV charging stations needed under a solar carport canopy from two to one, thereby making it easier for individuals or entities to qualify for the amortization of sales and use taxes on materials and equipment used in such projects. Furthermore, the amendment allocates $50,000 per year for fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27 from the Highway Fund to the Department of Transportation. These funds are designated for hiring a consultant to oversee the installation and operation of solar-powered EV charging stations at picnic areas.

The bill enacts 23 MRSA §710, mandating that any transportation construction project with a design commencing on or after January 1, 2026, and costing $500,000 or more, must identify and address locations on state highways and state aid highways that lack adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities, do not meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards, or present unsafe conditions for non-motorized users. Projects must also consult with affected municipalities to confirm connections with other transportation infrastructure, identify links to public transportation, and consider speed management techniques to reduce crash risks. Additionally, the legislation requires that posted speed limits within such projects be adjusted downward, with corresponding design modifications, in areas with higher crash potential, aligning with local plans and ordinances. Facilities must be planned, designed, and constructed to provide context-sensitive solutions that improve connectivity and safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users, including ADA-compliant sidewalks and bicycle facilities. Emergency repair projects and ongoing maintenance are exempt from these requirements, with maintenance to be conducted as per existing law.

The bill also enacts 23 MRSA §711, directing the Department of Transportation to prioritize state funding for transportation construction projects that meet specific criteria. These criteria include providing access for all users (pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation users), encouraging mixed land use and infill development, facilitating access to affordable or dense housing, promoting walkable neighborhoods, preserving open spaces and natural resources, and fostering robust community participation in project planning and scope. No specific funding amounts are allocated in the bill, but it establishes a framework for prioritizing projects that align with these goals.

The legislation modifies current law by inserting new sections (§710 and §711) into Title 23 of the Maine Revised Statutes, introducing requirements for project design, municipal consultation, speed management, and funding prioritization based on multi-modal access and community development principles. The key timeline is that the requirements apply to projects with design work commencing on or after January 1, 2026. The bill is particularly relevant to organizations focused on transportation safety, accessibility, sustainable development, and community engagement, as it seeks to ensure that state-funded transportation projects support safe, interconnected, and inclusive infrastructure for all users.

In summary, this act aims to improve the safety and connectivity of Maine's transportation network by requiring large-scale projects to address the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users, and by prioritizing funding for projects that promote mixed-use, walkable, and community-oriented development while preserving natural resources.",ME Rep.

The bill specifically revises the order of priorities that guide the state's integrated approach to managing both in-state and imported solid waste. The key modification is the elevation of 'waste processing that reduces the volume of waste needing land disposal, including incineration' from the fifth to the third priority in the hierarchy. Previously, this form of waste processing was ranked below recycling and composting; under the new structure, it is prioritized above recycling and composting but remains below waste reduction at the source and reuse. The bill does not specify any new funding allocations or deadlines, nor does it introduce additional regulatory requirements beyond the reordering of priorities. The legislation maintains the state's commitment to using this hierarchy as a guiding principle in all solid waste management decisions. This change is significant for organizations focused on waste management, environmental protection, and public health, as it may influence future policy decisions, resource allocation, and the development of waste processing infrastructure. The alignment with the organization's mission will depend on its stance regarding the environmental and health impacts of incineration and other waste processing technologies, as these are now given greater precedence over recycling and composting in the state's policy framework.","ME Rep.

The primary provisions include the repeal and replacement of existing statutes to simplify the excise tax imposed on mining companies. The new formula for calculating the excise tax is based on the gross proceeds of a mining company, multiplied by 0.05. The legislation also exempts unextracted minerals from property tax and provides for the refund of sales tax on depreciable machinery and equipment used in commercial mining. Additionally, the bill introduces administrative provisions related to tax filing, including extensions, amended returns, accounting periods, and estimated tax payments. It eliminates the Mining Impact Assistance Fund, which previously provided grants to offset property tax revenue losses and fund public facilities related to mining. Instead, 75% of the mining excise tax revenue will now be allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Trust Fund, with the remaining 25% directed to the General Fund. The legislation also repeals several sections of the Maine Revised Statutes, including definitions and provisions related to the mining excise tax, and clarifies the definition of ""tax year"" for these purposes. These changes are set to apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with specific provisions regarding sales tax refunds applicable to purchases made from that date.",ME Rep.

The bill repeals and amends multiple sections of Title 21-A of the Maine Revised Statutes, removing all statutory language and procedures related to RCV. Specifically, it repeals definitions and instructions pertaining to RCV, eliminates references to RCV in ballot arrangement, voting instructions, ballot counting, and election returns, and removes the statutory section (Section 723-A) that outlines the ranked-choice voting method. The bill also amends the process for tabulating votes and determining winners in both primary and general elections, reverting to a plurality system where the candidate with the most votes wins, regardless of whether they achieve a majority. This change applies to primary elections for President, U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative, Governor, State Senator, and State Representative, as well as general and special elections for U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative, and presidential electors. Additionally, the bill modifies the procedures for recounts and the certification of presidential electors to remove any references to RCV rounds or tabulation methods. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are mentioned in the bill. The key point of this legislation is the restoration of the traditional plurality voting system for all state and federal offices in Maine, aligning with organizations that advocate for or against specific voting methods. The bill's impact is significant for organizations focused on electoral reform, voting rights, and democratic processes, as it directly addresses the method by which votes are cast and counted in Maine's elections.","ME Rep.

Specifically, the bill modifies 35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§2, paragraphs B-3 and C, eliminating the requirement that eligible renewable energy sources—such as fuel cells, tidal power, geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, solar, wind, and waste-to-energy generators—must not exceed 100 megawatts in total production capacity. By striking this capacity cap, the legislation allows larger-scale renewable energy projects to be counted toward the state's RPS compliance, potentially increasing the pool of qualifying renewable energy resources. The bill does not introduce new funding provisions or specific financial allocations, nor does it set forth new deadlines or implementation timelines. The primary focus is on expanding eligibility criteria for renewable energy sources, which aligns with efforts to increase renewable energy generation and potentially reduce electricity costs by broadening the market for renewable energy providers.

Publicly owned land is defined broadly to include property rights held by federal, state, county, or municipal governments, encompassing easements, development rights, trust rights, and other ownership interests. The legislation provides a mechanism for exceeding this cap, allowing the state, county, or municipality to surpass the 50% threshold if two-thirds of each house of the Maine Legislature approves such an action. Additionally, the bill mandates that the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry must submit biannual reports, starting April 15, 2026, to the legislative committee responsible for public lands, detailing the percentage of publicly owned land both statewide and by county. This measure modifies current statutes by inserting a new section (12 MRSA §1829-A) that directly limits public land ownership and introduces new reporting requirements. The bill is particularly relevant to organizations focused on land use, conservation, and public access, as it may impact the expansion or management of public lands and conservation easements.
