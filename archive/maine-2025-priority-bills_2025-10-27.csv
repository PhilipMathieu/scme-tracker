Specifically, it replaces the previous funding amounts with a reduced allocation, providing $50,000 from the General Fund for each of the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27. These funds are designated as one-time funding for projects that meet certain criteria and are intended to improve or maintain the quality of lake waters in Maine. The amendment does not introduce new timelines or deadlines beyond the specified fiscal years, nor does it alter the underlying purpose of the fund, which remains focused on lake water quality restoration and protection. The primary change is the reduction in the amount of funding allocated for these purposes compared to the original committee amendment.","ME Rep. William ""Bill"" Bridgeo (D-ME-060)","ME Rep.

L.D. 556 (S.P. 218): An Act to Preserve Heating and Energy Choice by Prohibiting a Municipality from Prohibiting a Particular Energy System or Energy Distributor,Oppose,,Enacted,,Final Disposition: Enacted,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0218?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 556, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature, seeks to preserve consumer choice in heating and energy systems by prohibiting municipalities from enacting ordinances or regulations that ban the use of any safe and commercially available heating or energy system for individuals or entities, including for motor vehicles. The bill also prevents municipalities from restricting individuals or entities from hiring any person or energy distributor to install, connect, service, or resupply such systems, unless such prohibitions are specifically authorized by state statute. The definition of 'energy distributor' encompasses suppliers of oil, propane, natural gas, wood, renewable resources, and related energy services, with 'renewable resources' defined as per existing state law. The legislation does not prevent municipalities from encouraging or financially supporting particular energy systems, nor does it exempt energy distributors or installers from existing licensing or regulatory requirements. This bill amends Title 30-A of the Maine Revised Statutes by enacting section 3015, thereby limiting local government authority over energy system choices while maintaining state-level oversight and regulatory standards.",ME Sen.

L.D. 1270 (H.P. 845): An Act to Establish the Department of Energy Resources,Support,,Enacted,,Final Disposition: Enacted,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0845?legislature=132,"This House amendment to Committee Amendment ""A"" for L.D. 1270, ""An Act to Establish the Department of Energy Resources,"" introduces several significant changes to the bill and related statutes. The amendment revises the process by which the Bureau of Labor Standards determines the prevailing hourly wage and benefits rate in Maine's construction industry, as outlined in 26 MRSA §1308. It mandates that the Bureau collect three sets of wage and benefit data annually: from surveys, certified payrolls on state public works, and federal Davis-Bacon Act classifications. Labor unions are now required to submit their most recent collectively bargained rates each year. The Bureau must use the highest wage and benefits information from these sources to set the prevailing rate and is directed to limit any year-over-year decrease in the prevailing rate to no more than 15%. Additionally, the Bureau is required to consider wage and benefits information from both construction trade associations and labor unions in the locality of the public works project. The definition of ""benefits"" is clarified to include various forms of compensation beyond wages, such as health, pension, and vacation contributions.

The amendment also removes previous changes to the definition of ""Maine emerging industry compensation threshold"" and replaces the requirement for community and workforce enhancement standards with a new provision mandating that the Department of Energy Resources ensure wage, safety, and apprenticeship standards for contractors and subcontractors on state-assisted energy projects. Specifically, these standards require that all construction workers be paid at or above the prevailing wage and that contractors comply with relevant state labor laws (Title 26, Sections 1301, 1317, and 3502).

A new reporting requirement is established, directing the Department of Labor to submit a report by January 15, 2026, to the Joint Standing Committee on Labor. This report must detail the process and progress of using wage and benefits information from trade associations and labor unions in determining prevailing rates. The committee is authorized to introduce further legislation based on this report in the next legislative session.

These changes align with the organization's mission to promote fair labor standards, worker protections, and transparency in wage determination processes, particularly in the context of public works and state-assisted energy projects. The amendment strengthens requirements for prevailing wage calculations, ensures broader stakeholder input, and enhances oversight through mandated reporting.

In summary, the amendment refines wage determination procedures, strengthens labor standards for state energy projects, and increases transparency and accountability in the use of wage data, supporting the organization's focus on fair labor practices and worker protections.","ME Rep.

The amendment clarifies that any fee interests in land acquired under this program and held by the State cannot be sold or repurposed for uses other than those explicitly stated in chapter 353, unless such a change is approved by a two-thirds majority of the Legislature. This change strengthens the protection of state-held lands acquired through the program, ensuring that their use remains consistent with the original conservation and public benefit intentions unless there is significant legislative consensus to alter that use. The amendment does not introduce new funding provisions or deadlines, but it does reinforce legislative oversight and the safeguarding of public lands. This aligns with the mission of organizations focused on land conservation, public access, and responsible stewardship of natural resources, as it upholds the integrity and intended use of conserved lands.",ME Sen.

"L.D. 1355 (H.P. 878): Resolve, to Require the Governor's Energy Office to Study Taxation of Renewable Energy Infrastructure",Support,,Enacted,,Final Disposition: Finally Passed,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0878?legislature=132,"This Senate amendment to Committee Amendment 'A' for L.D. 1355 modifies the resolve directing the Governor's Energy Office to conduct a study on the taxation of renewable energy infrastructure in Maine. The amendment extends the deadline for the Governor's Energy Office to submit its report, including findings, recommendations, and any proposed legislation, from December 3, 2025, to November 4, 2026. The report must be developed in consultation with the Office of Tax Policy, renewable energy industry representatives, other experts, and relevant municipal and county officials, and must include public input. The amendment authorizes the Governor's Energy Office to receive funding from public or private sources to support the study, with a requirement to disclose all funding sources in the final report. Additionally, the amendment clarifies that the office is not obligated to undertake work for which it lacks sufficient funding. The joint standing committee of the Legislature with jurisdiction over taxation is empowered to introduce legislation based on the report to the 133rd Legislature in 2027. The amendment also removes the appropriations and allocations section from the original bill, shifting the funding mechanism to external contributions rather than direct legislative appropriation.

The amendment clarifies that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is authorized to design and implement the program only when funds are available, ensuring that the program's operation is contingent upon sufficient financial resources. Additionally, it explicitly allows the DEP to receive funds, grants, or contributions from both public and private sources to support the program's development and execution. The amendment also replaces the previous appropriations section with a baseline allocation, establishing an account with an annual allocation of $500 for fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27 to accept funding for contracted services related to the take-back and disposal of PFAS-containing foam. These changes ensure that the program will not proceed without adequate funding and provide flexibility for the DEP to seek external financial support.

The fund itself is composed of $2 from each deer registration fee and revenue from antlerless deer permit fees (minus administrative costs), which are designated for landowner-deer conflict management, predator control, and deer habitat acquisition or management. The amendment maintains the fund's separation from other state monies and continues to allow for the acceptance of monetary gifts, donations, or contributions from public or private sources. Additionally, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife is required to report annually to the relevant legislative committee on the fund's status and utilization. This change does not alter the purposes for which the fund may be used but enhances its financial management by allowing investment of its assets, potentially increasing available resources for wildlife and habitat management.",ME Rep.

This change clarifies eligibility criteria for low-income electric ratepayer assistance, ensuring that support is targeted to households with the greatest financial need. The amendment does not specify new funding amounts or allocations but focuses on refining eligibility standards.

First, it prohibits the Maine Department of Transportation from removing any portion of the specified railroad tracks if there is a pending request for proposals (RFP) from a train company or any other commercial enterprise seeking to use that section of track. Second, the amendment bars the Department from using state-provided funds or proceeds from state-issued bonds to finance the removal of these railroad tracks. These provisions modify the original resolve and committee amendment by adding protections for potential commercial rail use and by restricting the use of public funds for track removal.

L.D. 1423 (S.P. 579): An Act to Improve Recycling by Updating the Stewardship Program for Packaging,Support,,Enacted,,Final Disposition: Enacted,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0579?legislature=132,"This legislative amendment to Maine's stewardship program for packaging materials introduces several significant changes to the existing law (38 MRSA §2146). It revises and clarifies key definitions, including 'consumer,' 'packaging material,' 'post-consumer recycled material,' 'producer,' and 'toxicity.' Notably, the definition of 'packaging material' is expanded to exclude packaging associated with certain federally regulated products, such as drugs, medical devices, biologics, and products regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as well as specific nutritional supplements and medical foods. The amendment also refines the definition of 'producer' to clarify responsibility in various sales scenarios, including internet-based transactions, franchises, and cases where responsibility is contractually assigned to another party. Nonprofit organizations exempt under federal tax law are excluded from the definition of 'producer.'

The bill modifies producer exemption criteria, particularly for those dealing with perishable foods. Producers are now exempt from stewardship requirements for the first 15 tons of packaging material used for perishable food products sold or distributed in Maine during the previous calendar year. The definition of 'perishable food' is clarified to include fresh and processed meats, poultry, seafood, dairy, bakery products, eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables, but excludes most frozen foods except for frozen wild blueberries. Producers must provide documentation to the Department of Environmental Protection within 30 days if claiming an exemption.

The amendment enhances the requirements for the statewide recycling needs assessment, mandating that the stewardship organization evaluate the producer payment schedule's effectiveness in incentivizing the use of readily recyclable packaging and supporting Maine's solid waste management hierarchy. Following the execution of a contract with the Department of Environmental Protection, the stewardship organization may recommend changes to the payment schedule to further these goals, and the department may initiate rulemaking to implement such modifications.

Reporting and compliance provisions are also updated. The stewardship organization and the department must now provide and publish lists of compliant and non-compliant producers and brands, rather than relying solely on product UPCs. Producers are not required to report packaging material data using UPCs. Additionally, producers are protected from increased fees or penalties for not using post-consumer recycled material in packaging if such use is prohibited by state or federal law. Municipalities participating in the stewardship program are required to provide for the collection and recycling of any readily recyclable packaging material generated within their jurisdiction.

Overall, these changes aim to clarify responsibilities, streamline exemptions, and better align the stewardship program with Maine's recycling and waste management objectives, while ensuring compliance with federal regulations and providing flexibility for producers and municipalities.",ME Sen.

First, it removes provisions that would have directed the Governor’s Energy Office to conduct procurements of renewable and clean energy resources and authorized the office to adopt related rules, as well as the section imposing a special assessment on investor-owned utilities for office expenditures. The amendment revises the definition of 'Class III resource' or 'clean resource' to include sources such as nuclear power plants and hydroelectric generators that comply with all state and federal fish passage requirements, and it sets criteria for other sources to qualify as Class III resources, including those with minimal greenhouse gas and co-pollutant emissions as certified by the Department of Environmental Protection and the Governor's Energy Office. Additionally, the amendment clarifies that the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) may coordinate with other states to procure transmission capacity, capacity resources, renewable energy credits, or clean energy credits through long-term contracts or other mechanisms, provided that the likely benefits to Maine ratepayers exceed the likely costs. The amendment also removes the requirement for the PUC to conduct a competitive solicitation for energy or renewable energy credits from eligible Class IA resources and makes various technical changes for consistency throughout the bill. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are introduced in this amendment. The changes align with the state's clean energy and climate goals by broadening the definition of clean resources and enabling regional coordination, but they also reduce the direct role of the Governor’s Energy Office in procurement and oversight.",ME Sen.

L.D. 529 (H.P. 348): An Act to Establish the Alamoosook Lake Watershed Management District,Support,,Sent to Executive,,Final Disposition: Emergency Enacted,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0348?legislature=132,"This legislative amendment establishes the Alamoosook Lake Watershed Management District as a quasi-municipal corporation in the Town of Orland, Maine, subject to approval by local voters through a referendum to be held after June 1, 2025 and within two years of the Act’s effective date. The district is created to assume ownership, maintenance, and operation of the dam on Alamoosook Lake, following a petition by the current dam owner for release of ownership under Maine law (Title 38, chapter 5, subchapter 1, article 6). The district will also coordinate water level management and undertake watershed improvement activities, such as fish passage enhancements, water quality monitoring, and invasive species control. The district’s governance will be managed by a five-member board of trustees, with three appointed by the Town of Orland and two elected by waterfront property owners, ensuring representation from both the municipality and local stakeholders. Trustees serve staggered terms, and the board is responsible for financial management, public communications, and policy development for the watershed. Funding for the district’s operations will be split evenly: 50% from the Town of Orland (subject to annual voter approval) and 50% from assessments on waterfront property owners, calculated based on shoreline frontage (capped at 300 feet per property). If the town fails to appropriate its share, the shortfall is covered by increased assessments on property owners. The district is exempt from local taxation, qualifies for grants and loans as a municipality, and is eligible for state agency assistance. The Act includes provisions for public budget hearings, annual budget approval processes, and mechanisms for the Town of Orland to withdraw from the district or for the district to dissolve. The emergency preamble allows for immediate action to meet statutory deadlines related to dam ownership transfer and municipal consultation. The legislation aligns with environmental stewardship and local governance by providing a structured, community-based approach to dam and watershed management, ensuring both municipal and property owner participation in decision-making and funding.",ME Rep.

L.D. 138 (S.P. 74): An Act Regarding the Permitting of Projects Affecting Public-use Airports Under the Natural Resources Protection Act and the Site Location of Development Laws,Oppose,,Enacted,,Final Disposition: Enacted,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0074?legislature=132,"This legislative amendment to Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act and the site location of development laws stipulates that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) may not impose any permit conditions that would, in the department's determination, decrease safety within the air operations area of a public-use airport. The amendment provides clear definitions for 'public-use airport,' 'airport security program,' and 'air operations area,' referencing relevant federal statutes and regulations. Specifically, a 'public-use airport' is defined according to 49 U.S.C. §47102(22), an 'airport security program' is one approved by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration under 49 C.F.R. §1542.101, and 'air operations area' is defined as per 14 C.F.R. §153.3, with additional clarification for airports lacking a formal security program. The amendment replaces the original bill, which sought to exempt airports from certain state endangered and threatened species habitat protections, by instead focusing on ensuring that environmental permitting does not compromise airport operational safety. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are included in the amendment. The key point relevant to organizations concerned with environmental regulation and public safety is the prioritization of airport safety over the imposition of certain environmental permit conditions within designated operational areas.

The amendment introduces clear definitions for 'critical terrestrial habitat,' 'significant vernal pool habitat,' and 'significant vernal pool protection zone.' Specifically, it defines the protection zone as the area within 100 feet of the high-water mark of a significant vernal pool and mandates that, to the greatest extent practicable, no disturbance should occur within both the vernal pool depression and this protection zone. The amendment also modifies existing law by removing a previous exemption that allowed landowners to avoid regulation if the vernal pool depression was not on their property. Now, if the critical terrestrial habitat of a significant vernal pool crosses property boundaries, all affected properties must receive equal habitat protections, regardless of whether the vernal pool depression itself is present on a given parcel. Additionally, the amendment establishes criteria for determining when a vernal pool is not considered significant based on its drying period: in northern Maine, if the pool dries out before July 15th, and in southern Maine, before July 1st, it may be deemed not significant by either the Department of Environmental Protection or the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are detailed in the text, but a fiscal note is required. These changes align with the organization's mission to protect critical wildlife habitats and ensure consistent regulatory standards for vernal pool conservation across property boundaries.","ME Rep.

Beginning July 1, 2026, before such projects can be included in official transportation plans, an impact assessment must be conducted to project the 20-year greenhouse gas emissions and VMT impacts, including induced demand. If a project is found to increase annual greenhouse gas emissions or per capita VMT, the responsible agency must either redesign the project, incorporate sufficient mitigation measures (such as transit expansion, active transportation infrastructure, or land use changes), or halt the project. Mitigation measures must be specifically funded, localized to affected or underserved communities when possible, and result in a neutral or net reduction in emissions and VMT. The law also mandates public transparency by requiring publication of all assessments and mitigation actions online, and biennial reporting to the Governor and relevant legislative committees, including public meetings and opportunities for comment. Projects already included in plans or with approved layouts before July 1, 2026, are exempt. Additionally, the amendment requires the Department of Transportation to adopt rules to ensure compliance with statutory emissions levels and provides funding for two new staff positions and consultants to support these activities, with appropriations totaling $1,109,476 in FY 2025-26 and $362,372 in FY 2026-27.

The amendment makes several technical corrections to the original bill, including clarifying departmental references and relettering sections for consistency. A significant policy change introduced by the amendment is the restriction placed on the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, who is now prohibited from adopting rules to protect plants under the relevant subchapter unless such action is necessary for the conservation of rare, threatened, or endangered fish or wildlife. This narrows the scope of plant protection to cases directly impacting animal conservation, potentially limiting broader plant conservation efforts. Additionally, the amendment removes a provision that would have required a duplicative consistency review of comprehensive municipal growth management plans by the DIFW, streamlining administrative processes and avoiding redundancy.

The amendment mandates that by January 15, 2027, the DIFW must submit a report to the Legislature's relevant committees detailing the outcomes, findings, and recommendations regarding the transfer of the Natural Areas Program. This report may inform future legislative action, as the committees are authorized to propose related legislation to the 133rd Legislature in 2027. This timeline ensures legislative oversight and the opportunity for further adjustments based on the program's performance post-transfer.

In terms of funding, the amendment details the transfer of personnel and associated funds from the DACF to the DIFW. Specifically, it reallocates one Public Service Manager II, one Resource Management Coordinator, and five Biologist II positions, along with their respective funding streams, from the DACF's Natural Areas Program to the DIFW's Resource Management Services. The financial adjustments for fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27 are outlined, with reductions in the DACF's budget and corresponding increases in the DIFW's budget across the General Fund, Federal Expenditures Fund, and Other Special Revenue Funds. The amendment also establishes a baseline allocation for the Natural Areas Conservation Fund within the DIFW.

Key points relevant to conservation and natural resource management include the administrative realignment of the Natural Areas Program, the narrowed regulatory authority over plant protection, and the requirement for legislative review of the program's transfer. These changes align with the organization's mission if it is focused on efficient government operations and the integration of wildlife and natural area management, but may raise concerns for those prioritizing comprehensive plant conservation, as the amendment limits regulatory protections for plants unless tied to animal conservation needs.

Overall, the amendment seeks to streamline the administration of Maine's natural areas by consolidating programs under the DIFW, clarifies regulatory authority, and ensures legislative oversight, while also making significant changes to the scope of plant protection and the allocation of state resources.","ME Rep.

The increased height must not exceed one foot above the base flood elevation, and the seawall's other dimensions cannot be altered. Applicants are required to mitigate any increased erosion or scouring caused by the height increase, and, where space allows, must construct or plant native dune vegetation landward of the seawall. For projects involving multiple contiguous lots, the amendment stipulates that the cumulative effect of seawall height increases must not exacerbate flood risks to neighboring properties as determined by engineering analysis. The amendment also clarifies that certain stabilization materials and construction methods are permissible when used in conjunction with existing seawalls, and it allows for the use of metal stakes, anchors, or cables in these contexts under a permit by rule. Additionally, the bill modifies existing law to permit the replacement of seawalls destroyed or threatened by emergencies to be rebuilt with an increased height, in line with the new provisions.

The program is designed to hold fossil fuel extractors and refiners financially accountable for their proportional contribution to greenhouse gas emissions in Maine during the period from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2024. Entities responsible for more than one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during this period are subject to strict liability and will receive cost recovery demands from the Department. These demands are calculated based on the entity's share of emissions relative to the total emissions from all responsible parties, and payments can be made in full within six months or in nine annual installments, with the first installment due within six months. The legislation also provides mechanisms for reconsideration and judicial review of cost recovery demands, and clarifies that it does not preempt other legal remedies or liabilities under state or common law.

Funds collected through the program are deposited into the newly established Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program Fund. This fund is dedicated to supporting climate change adaptation projects across the state, including infrastructure upgrades, nature-based solutions, public health initiatives, and resilience improvements for communities, especially those most vulnerable to climate impacts. At least 35% of the fund's expenditures must benefit low-income and environmentally overburdened communities, aligning with environmental justice principles. The fund may also be used for administrative costs, implementation of relevant components of the state climate action plan, and reimbursement of state agencies for program-related expenses. Unexpended balances and interest remain in the fund for future use.

The Act mandates the Department to develop and regularly update a resilience implementation strategy, in consultation with the Maine Climate Council, relevant state agencies, stakeholders, and affected communities. This strategy will identify, prioritize, and guide the funding of adaptation projects, with a focus on using the best available science and public engagement, particularly in disadvantaged and high-risk areas. The Department is also required to adopt rules for program administration, including methodologies for identifying responsible parties and calculating emissions shares.

To ensure transparency and accountability, the State Auditor is tasked with evaluating the program's operation and effectiveness every five years starting January 1, 2031, and reporting findings and recommendations to relevant legislative committees. Additionally, the Treasurer of State must submit a comprehensive report by December 31, 2026, assessing the costs to Maine from greenhouse gas emissions over the covered period, including impacts on public health, natural resources, and the economy, as well as the costs of abatement efforts.

This legislation represents a significant modification to Maine's environmental statutes by introducing a new chapter (38 MRSA c. 3-C) and establishing a novel mechanism for cost recovery from major climate polluters.

Notably, the bill explicitly adds electric vehicles as an eligible use of these funds, alongside high-performance air source heat pump technology. The legislation also updates statutory language to clarify that these funds can be used to support any beneficial electrification measures that meet the cost-effectiveness and reliability criteria, thereby expanding the scope of eligible projects. There are no specific new funding amounts or deadlines introduced in this bill; rather, it modifies the allowable uses and timeframes for existing revenue streams. This change aligns with efforts to advance Maine’s clean energy transition, reduce electricity costs for consumers, and support the adoption of technologies that decrease reliance on fossil fuels.",ME Sen.

L.D. 905 (S.P. 394): An Act to Clarify the Process to Transfer Funds Resulting from the Expiration of Unused Kilowatt-hour Credits to Be Used to Provide Assistance to Low-income Electricity Customers,Support,,Enacted,,Final Disposition: Enacted,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0394?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 905, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature, amends the process by which unused kilowatt-hour credits from net energy billing arrangements are managed and allocated. The bill modifies 35-A MRSA §3209-A, sub-§8, by changing the recipient of the value of expired, unused kilowatt-hour credits from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to the administrators of the statewide low-income assistance plan and individual low-income assistance programs, as designated by the PUC through rulemaking. This adjustment ensures that the financial benefits from unused credits directly support low-income electricity customers. Additionally, the bill extends the annual deadline for utilities to remit these funds from January 1st to April 1st, providing utilities with additional time to process and transfer the credits. The legislation also introduces a new reporting requirement: utilities must now report to the PUC the number and monetary value of unused kilowatt-hour credits that expired in the previous calendar year. These changes are to be implemented through routine technical rulemaking by the PUC. The bill aligns with efforts to enhance support for low-income electricity customers by streamlining the transfer and reporting of unused net energy billing credits, thereby improving transparency and ensuring that assistance reaches those in need more efficiently.",ME Sen.

L.D. 257 (S.P. 124): An Act to Eliminate the Practice of Net Energy Billing,Oppose,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Ought Not To Pass Pursuant To Joint Rule 310,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0124?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 257, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature, proposes the complete elimination of net energy billing (NEB) in the state. The bill repeals several sections of Maine law (notably 35-A MRSA §§3209-A, 3209-B, 3209-C, 3209-E, and related provisions) that previously authorized and regulated NEB programs, which allowed customers generating renewable electricity (such as from solar panels) to receive credits on their utility bills for excess energy supplied to the grid. The legislation explicitly prohibits the Public Utilities Commission from requiring transmission and distribution utilities to offer NEB to customers, effectively ending the practice statewide. Additionally, the bill amends property tax statutes (36 MRSA §§655 and 656) to remove exemptions for solar energy equipment that is used in conjunction with NEB, limiting such exemptions only to equipment where all generated energy is used on-site. The bill also makes conforming changes to other statutes to remove references to NEB and repeals related sales tax exemptions. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are included in the bill, but the changes would take effect for property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2025. The key impact of this legislation is the cessation of state support for NEB, which may affect the financial incentives for residential, commercial, and institutional customers to invest in distributed renewable energy generation. This aligns with a policy shift away from NEB as a mechanism for promoting distributed renewable energy, potentially impacting organizations focused on renewable energy deployment, energy equity, and climate action in Maine.",,
L.D. 32 (S.P. 49): An Act to Repeal the Laws Regarding Net Energy Billing,Oppose,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Work Session Held Tabled,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0049?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 32, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature, proposes a comprehensive repeal of all state laws and regulations related to net energy billing (NEB). The bill eliminates the authority of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish or enforce NEB programs, which previously allowed utility customers to receive bill credits for electricity generated by their own or shared renewable energy systems, such as solar panels. Specifically, the bill repeals Title 35-A, sections 3209-A, 3209-B, 3209-C, 3209-D (in part), and 3209-E, which collectively governed the structure, eligibility, and operation of NEB for both residential and commercial customers. It also enacts a new section, 3209-F, explicitly prohibiting the PUC from requiring utilities to offer NEB to customers, thereby ending the practice statewide.

The legislation further amends related statutes to remove references to NEB, including those affecting property and real estate tax exemptions for solar energy equipment. Under the revised law, only solar energy equipment that uses all generated energy on-site will remain eligible for certain tax exemptions, eliminating benefits for systems participating in NEB or transmitting energy through utility infrastructure for off-site crediting. Additionally, the bill repeals a sales tax exemption for certain renewable energy equipment and makes technical changes to ensure consistency across Maine statutes by deleting or amending provisions that previously referenced NEB programs.

No specific funding allocations or financial figures are included in the bill, as its primary focus is regulatory repeal and statutory amendment rather than appropriations. The bill does not establish new deadlines for compliance but sets the effective date for tax-related changes to property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2025. This timeline ensures that property owners and municipalities have clarity regarding the eligibility of solar energy equipment for tax exemptions in future tax years.

The key points of the bill are the full repeal of NEB programs, the prohibition of future NEB requirements by the PUC, and the narrowing of tax benefits to on-site solar energy use only. These changes significantly impact Maine's renewable energy landscape, particularly for organizations and individuals who have invested in or advocated for distributed solar and community energy projects. The bill aligns with a policy shift away from incentivizing customer-owned or shared renewable generation through utility bill credits, potentially affecting the growth of distributed renewable energy and related economic and environmental benefits in the state.

For organizations focused on advancing renewable energy access, distributed generation, and climate action, this legislation represents a substantial rollback of supportive policies. It may hinder efforts to expand solar adoption, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote energy equity, as NEB has been a key mechanism for enabling broader participation in clean energy generation.",ME Sen.

Specifically, beginning December 31, 2026, the law requires that at least 50% of such electricity delivered into Maine via these transmission lines must be allocated for and consumed within the state. The Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is prohibited from issuing certificates of public convenience and necessity for new high-impact transmission lines that do not meet this standard, unless compliance would interfere with grid reliability or regional energy security agreements. This requirement, along with related provisions, is set to be repealed on December 31, 2031.

The act introduces quarterly reporting obligations for operators of high-impact transmission lines, mandating detailed disclosures on the amounts of electricity delivered to Maine, consumed within the state, and exported to other states. Noncompliance with these requirements can result in administrative penalties, with fines capped at $575,000 or 5% of the operator's gross revenue from out-of-state electricity sales per quarter, whichever is lower. All penalties collected are directed to the newly established Public Utilities Commission Energy Affordability Fund, which is to be used to provide rebates to Maine electricity customers, thereby aiming to enhance energy affordability in the state.

Additionally, the legislation tasks the Governor's Energy Office with collaborating with utilities and economic development agencies to attract and expand energy-intensive industries in Maine, potentially through electricity rate incentives. Starting December 31, 2027, transmission and distribution utilities and competitive electricity providers must submit annual reports to the PUC detailing their efforts to support business expansion or relocation to Maine, with a focus on actions that reduce electricity costs for customers.

The act sets forth several key deadlines: by December 31, 2025, the PUC must report to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology with recommendations on reducing electricity costs and ensuring compliance with the local consumption standard. By December 31, 2030, the PUC must provide a comprehensive assessment of the local consumption standard's impact on Maine electricity customers and regional energy markets, including recommendations on whether to continue the requirement. The PUC is also required to initiate rulemaking within 90 days of the act's effective date to implement these provisions.

The bill amends several sections of Title 21-A, Chapter 14 of the Maine Revised Statutes to redefine 'certified candidate,' 'nonparticipating candidate,' and 'participating candidate' to encompass these two offices, in addition to the existing inclusion of Governor, State Senator, and State Representative. The act also updates the qualifying period, campaign finance rules, and fund distribution procedures to apply to Secretary of State and Attorney General candidates, and directs the Maine Ethics Commission to establish specific terms of participation for these offices, including contribution limits, qualifying requirements, and distribution amounts. The commission is instructed to consider the relative difficulty of certification and the distribution amounts for other offices when setting these terms, and may differentiate between the two new offices as needed. The act's implementation is contingent upon the passage of a constitutional amendment that would provide for the popular election of the Secretary of State and Attorney General and apply ranked-choice voting to these elections.

This prohibition is set to take effect after January 1, 2027, providing a clear timeline for businesses and consumers to transition away from these materials. The bill does not specify any funding allocations or financial provisions, nor does it outline penalties or enforcement mechanisms within the provided text. The primary modification to existing law is the explicit addition of the ban on loose polystyrene packing materials, which aligns with broader environmental protection efforts by aiming to reduce non-biodegradable waste and promote sustainable packaging alternatives. This legislative action is particularly relevant to organizations focused on environmental conservation, waste reduction, and public health, as it addresses the issue of plastic pollution and its impact on ecosystems.

L.D. 1262 (H.P. 837): An Act to Improve Government Transparency and Accountability by Establishing a Process to Allow a Person to Require the State to Enforce Certain Laws and Rules,Support,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Ought Not To Pass Pursuant To Joint Rule 310,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0837?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 1262, titled 'An Act to Improve Government Transparency and Accountability by Establishing a Process to Allow a Person to Require the State to Enforce Certain Laws and Rules,' proposes several amendments to the Maine Administrative Procedure Act. The bill introduces a formal process allowing individuals to petition state agencies or the Attorney General to enforce existing laws or rules, specifically those related to the environment, natural resources, public health or safety, and government transparency. Agencies or the Attorney General must respond to such petitions within 60 days, either by initiating enforcement proceedings or providing a written denial with reasons; failure to do so enables the petitioner to seek judicial review. The legislation also amends existing statutes to clarify that adjudicatory proceedings initiated under this new process are subject to the same procedural rules as other agency proceedings, with certain exceptions for specific boards and correctional facilities.

A significant feature of the bill is the establishment of the Fund for Administrative Oversight within the Office of the Attorney General. This non-lapsing, dedicated fund is administered by an appointee of the Governor and is designed to support individuals who petition for rulemaking, enforcement, or participation in agency proceedings, particularly those not representing commercial or regulated entities and whose interests focus on environmental protection, public health, safety, or government transparency. The fund can receive revenue from various sources, including legislative appropriations, grants, and contributions. Distribution of funds prioritizes individuals or groups whose interests are not otherwise adequately represented and who are primarily concerned with the public interest areas outlined above. The administrator is also tasked with public education about the fund’s availability.

To finance the fund, the bill directs the Office of the Attorney General to collaborate with relevant state agencies to develop a mechanism for imposing additional fees on licenses, permits, or approvals related to regulated activities in the bill’s focus areas. These fees must be reasonable, not unduly burdensome, and reflect the cost of agency oversight and potential corrective actions. By January 1, 2026, the Attorney General’s office must report recommendations and proposed legislation for these fees to the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government, with the intent that fee collection begins July 1, 2026. The collected fees are to be split evenly, with half retained by the agency for oversight and enforcement and half transferred to the Fund for Administrative Oversight.

The bill’s key points align with the mission of organizations focused on government transparency, environmental protection, and public health advocacy. It enhances public participation in government oversight, provides financial support for non-commercial actors to engage in regulatory processes, and seeks to ensure that state agencies are held accountable for enforcing laws and rules in critical public interest areas. The establishment of a dedicated fund and a clear petition process, along with judicial review rights, are designed to empower individuals and organizations to promote transparency and accountability in state governance.

In summary, this legislation creates new avenues for public enforcement of state laws and rules, establishes a funding mechanism to support such civic engagement, and sets forth a timeline for implementing related fee structures, all with the goal of improving transparency, accountability, and public participation in Maine’s regulatory processes.",ME Rep.

The amendment expands the scope of the bill by including energy storage units, in addition to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, as eligible infrastructure at highway picnic areas. It modifies the requirements for tax incentives by reducing the minimum number of EV charging stations needed under a solar carport canopy from two to one, thereby making it easier for individuals or entities to qualify for the amortization of sales and use taxes on materials and equipment used in such projects. Furthermore, the amendment allocates $50,000 per year for fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27 from the Highway Fund to the Department of Transportation. These funds are designated for hiring a consultant to oversee the installation and operation of solar-powered EV charging stations at picnic areas.

The PUC, in consultation with the Office of the Public Advocate, the Governor's Energy Office, and the Efficiency Maine Trust, is required to issue a request for information to relevant stakeholders. This request seeks input on opportunities for the PUC to engage in energy cost reduction contracts or physical energy storage contracts, in line with beneficial electrification principles and existing state statutes (specifically, Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, chapter 19). Additionally, the PUC must gather information on current and near-term alternatives to natural gas for commercial and industrial use, including their availability, cost, and the necessary steps to ensure a reliable and cost-effective supply of these alternatives.

The legislation also mandates that the PUC contact all gas utilities and natural gas pipeline utilities within Maine, as well as those in neighboring states and provinces, to negotiate favorable terms for energy cost reduction contracts, physical energy storage contracts, or other suitable arrangements. The goal of these negotiations is to lower energy costs for Maine consumers and further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A key timeline established by the resolve is the requirement for the PUC to submit a comprehensive report to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology by December 3, 2025. This report must summarize the responses received from the information request, detail any actions taken as a result, and provide an overview of the commission's negotiations with utilities. The committee is authorized to introduce related legislation in the subsequent session based on the report's findings.

The resolve does not specify new funding allocations or make direct amendments to existing statutes, but it does reinforce the state's commitment to beneficial electrification and the transition away from natural gas in commercial and industrial sectors. The legislation aligns with Maine's broader goals of reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the organization's mission to promote clean, affordable, and reliable energy solutions.

The primary change introduced by this bill is to clarify that all portfolio requirements for Class I, Class IA, and Class II renewable resources, as well as related exemptions and multipliers, apply exclusively to actual retail electricity sales, rather than to other forms of electricity transactions or supply arrangements. The bill specifically inserts language into the relevant statutory subsections to state that portfolio requirements are limited to actual retail sales, ensuring that only electricity sold directly to end-use customers is subject to these renewable resource mandates. The legislation also maintains existing provisions such as the 300% multiplier for certain municipal solid waste generators (set to be repealed January 1, 2027) and the exemption for contracts in effect as of September 19, 2019, but clarifies that these too are tied to actual retail sales.

The bill is designated as emergency legislation, allowing it to take effect immediately upon approval. Key funding provisions include allocations for the Department of Public Safety to support personnel reclassifications within the State Police, totaling $24,135, and for the Department of the Secretary of State to address increased technology costs, postage, contract expenses for issuing credentials, and several position reclassifications, amounting to $345,369. The Department of Transportation receives a one-time capital expenditure allocation of $15 million in the Multimodal Transportation Fund, offset by an equivalent reduction in personal services due to anticipated vacancies, resulting in a net zero change for the department's Highway Fund allocation for the year. Additionally, the bill adjusts the Multimodal Transportation Fund to align with updated revenue projections, reducing other special revenue funds by $138,121.

The legislation also includes provisions to carry forward unexpended funds. Specifically, up to $9 million in the 'All Other' line category for the Department of Secretary of State, Administration - Motor Vehicles program may be carried forward from fiscal year 2024-25 to 2025-26, with $2 million earmarked for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles modernization project and $7 million for the new license plate general issue project. Another provision allows up to $2.5 million in unexpended balances from the same program to be carried forward to continue modernization efforts at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. These carry-forward provisions extend the time frame for utilizing previously authorized funds, particularly to accommodate the plate manufacturing billing process and ongoing system upgrades.

The bill modifies existing law by authorizing these specific fund carry-forwards and allocations, some of which were previously permitted under Public Law 2023, chapter 50, Part B. The changes ensure that critical modernization projects and operational needs in public safety, transportation, and motor vehicle administration are adequately funded and can proceed without interruption. No new taxes or fees are introduced, and the bill primarily reallocates existing resources to meet emergent and ongoing needs.

The timelines established by the bill are focused on the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, with carry-forward provisions extending the use of certain funds into the subsequent fiscal year. The immediate effective date underscores the urgency of maintaining uninterrupted government operations and supporting public safety, transportation infrastructure, and modernization of motor vehicle services.

The bill specifies the material composition and durability requirements for reusable bags, such as minimum percentages of post-consumer recycled fiber or nonwood renewable fiber for paper bags, and minimum standards for reusability and strength for both fabric and plastic bags. The definition of 'point of sale' is expanded to include not only traditional checkout counters but also self-service kiosks, in-store or curbside pickup locations, and any other location, including the customer's home, where merchandise is delivered or transferred. The act increases the mandatory fee that retail establishments must charge for each recycled paper or reusable plastic carry-out bag from 5 cents to 10 cents, with the collected fees retained by the retailer for any lawful purpose. Exemptions from the fee requirement remain for small stores, restaurants, and hunger relief organizations. The law also reinforces statewide preemption, prohibiting local governments from enacting their own regulations on carry-out bags, ensuring uniform application across Maine. These amendments are set to take effect on January 1, 2026.

The bill revises the definition of 'cookware product' under 38 MRSA §1614 to exclude polymer-coated durable items that are authorized for food contact by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), thereby permitting their sale in Maine. Additionally, the act modifies restrictions on cookware products with cooking surfaces intended for direct contact with food or beverages that contain intentionally added PFAS. The amendment clarifies that the prohibition does not apply to cookware products with cooking surfaces made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), or perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA), which are specific types of PFAS commonly used in nonstick coatings. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are mentioned in the bill.

The bill achieves this by repealing relevant chapters and subsections in Titles 35-A and 38 of the Maine Revised Statutes, removing language that conditions legislative or regulatory approval on subsequent voter ratification. No new funding allocations or deadlines are specified in the bill. The key change is the shift of final decision-making authority from the general electorate to the state legislature and regulatory agencies, streamlining the approval process for nuclear-related projects and agreements. This legislative change is significant for organizations focused on energy policy, environmental safety, and public participation in major infrastructure decisions, as it reduces direct public oversight in favor of legislative and regulatory control.

The bill amends existing statutes to restrict the open season for hunting coyotes to the period from October 1st to March 31st, replacing the previous season of December 16th to August 31st. This change shortens the legal hunting period and aims to provide clearer seasonal boundaries for coyote management. Additionally, the bill strengthens penalties for violations related to coyote hunting. Individuals convicted of hunting coyotes outside the designated season or without the required permit, particularly at night, will face a mandatory revocation of their hunting license for one year and a minimum fine of $500. These penalties are more severe than previous provisions, which included lower fines and did not mandate license revocation for all violations. The legislation also allows the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to appoint agents to hunt coyotes at night using artificial illumination from September 1st to December 15th, with a requirement to inform the public and law enforcement about such operations.

The bill enacts 23 MRSA §710, mandating that any transportation construction project with a design commencing on or after January 1, 2026, and costing $500,000 or more, must identify and address locations on state highways and state aid highways that lack adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities, do not meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards, or present unsafe conditions for non-motorized users. Projects must also consult with affected municipalities to confirm connections with other transportation infrastructure, identify links to public transportation, and consider speed management techniques to reduce crash risks. Additionally, the legislation requires that posted speed limits within such projects be adjusted downward, with corresponding design modifications, in areas with higher crash potential, aligning with local plans and ordinances. Facilities must be planned, designed, and constructed to provide context-sensitive solutions that improve connectivity and safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users, including ADA-compliant sidewalks and bicycle facilities. Emergency repair projects and ongoing maintenance are exempt from these requirements, with maintenance to be conducted as per existing law.

The bill also enacts 23 MRSA §711, directing the Department of Transportation to prioritize state funding for transportation construction projects that meet specific criteria. These criteria include providing access for all users (pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation users), encouraging mixed land use and infill development, facilitating access to affordable or dense housing, promoting walkable neighborhoods, preserving open spaces and natural resources, and fostering robust community participation in project planning and scope. No specific funding amounts are allocated in the bill, but it establishes a framework for prioritizing projects that align with these goals.

The legislation modifies current law by inserting new sections (§710 and §711) into Title 23 of the Maine Revised Statutes, introducing requirements for project design, municipal consultation, speed management, and funding prioritization based on multi-modal access and community development principles. The key timeline is that the requirements apply to projects with design work commencing on or after January 1, 2026. The bill is particularly relevant to organizations focused on transportation safety, accessibility, sustainable development, and community engagement, as it seeks to ensure that state-funded transportation projects support safe, interconnected, and inclusive infrastructure for all users.

In summary, this act aims to improve the safety and connectivity of Maine's transportation network by requiring large-scale projects to address the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users, and by prioritizing funding for projects that promote mixed-use, walkable, and community-oriented development while preserving natural resources.",ME Rep.

L.D. 395 (S.P. 181): An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneficial to the Wabanaki Nations,Support,,Introduced or Prefiled,,"Carried Over, In The Same Posture, To Any Special Or Regular Session Of The 132Nd Legislature, Pursuant To Joint Order Sp 800.",https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0181?legislature=132,"This legislative act seeks to amend the Maine Implementing Act and related statutes to restore and clarify the application of federal laws and regulations that are generally applicable to or enacted for the benefit of Native American tribes, specifically the Passamaquoddy Tribe, Penobscot Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, and Mi'kmaq Nation, within the State of Maine. The bill addresses the limitations imposed by the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act (Public Law 96-420), which had previously restricted the application of certain federal Indian laws if they affected or preempted the state's civil, criminal, or regulatory jurisdiction, particularly in areas such as land use and environmental regulation. The new provisions establish that, except as otherwise specified, any federal law or regulation that grants a special status or right to Indian tribes or their lands will apply to these tribes in Maine, regardless of its impact on state law, unless it would create a regulatory gap in public health or safety, in which case state law would fill that gap.

The act creates separate but substantively identical sections for each of the four tribes, affirming their ability to benefit from federal Indian laws and to enact their own laws and ordinances related to the implementation of such federal statutes. However, it maintains certain exceptions: the tribes may only conduct gaming activities in accordance with Maine state law and not under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act; state criminal and juvenile laws continue to apply to the tribes, and conflicting federal statutes do not apply unless specifically made applicable in Maine; and key federal environmental laws (the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Water Quality Act of 1987, and Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, including future amendments) do not apply to the tribes to the extent that they would preempt state law or extend tribal jurisdiction beyond their lands, unless specifically made applicable by federal law.

The legislation also establishes a notification process: if a tribe believes a state law does not apply due to the operation of federal law, it must notify the Maine Attorney General, who is expected to respond within 30 days if the state disagrees. The absence of such notice or response does not limit the rights of either party to assert their positions in future disputes. The act further provides for contingent repeal: if a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the act is ineffective in causing federal Indian laws to apply to the tribes, the relevant provisions are repealed, with notification requirements for state and tribal officials.

Implementation of the act for each tribe is contingent upon written certification of agreement from the respective tribal governing bodies within 90 days after the adjournment of the legislative session, with the act taking effect 120 days after adjournment if such certification is received. For the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi'kmaq Nation, the act also constitutes a jurisdictional agreement for purposes of the relevant federal settlement acts. The bill does not include any specific funding provisions or financial allocations.

Overall, this legislation is designed to enhance tribal sovereignty and self-determination by enabling Maine's federally recognized tribes to access the full range of federal Indian laws and benefits, while preserving certain areas of state jurisdiction, particularly in gaming, criminal law, and environmental regulation, and establishing clear procedures for resolving jurisdictional disputes.

This bill restores access to federal Indian laws for Maine's tribes, allowing them to benefit from federal statutes and enact their own laws, while maintaining state jurisdiction over gaming, criminal law, and certain environmental matters, contingent on tribal agreement and subject to judicial review.",ME Sen.

The bill also amends several related statutes to remove references to these renewable energy goals. Specifically, it modifies the criteria used by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) when evaluating proposals for energy transmission and renewable energy development in northern Maine, eliminating the requirement to consider alignment with the state's renewable energy goals. Instead, the focus shifts to factors such as cost, economic benefit, bidder qualifications, and maximizing benefits to the state. Additionally, the bill amends the Maine Offshore Wind Renewable Energy and Economic Development Program by removing the mandate to advance the now-repealed renewable energy goals, though it retains references to greenhouse gas reduction obligations and climate policies under other sections of Maine law (Title 38, sections 576-A and 577). The legislation also updates language in statutes governing offshore wind transmission infrastructure to reflect the repeal of the renewable energy goals. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are included in the bill. The primary impact of this legislation is to eliminate the statutory framework guiding Maine's transition to renewable electricity, which may affect the state's approach to energy policy, climate action, and economic development in the clean energy sector.

The bill eliminates the authority of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish or enforce NEB programs, which previously allowed customers who generated their own electricity—often through solar panels—to receive credits or adjustments on their utility bills for energy supplied back to the grid. Specifically, the bill repeals several sections of Title 35-A, including §§3209-A, 3209-B, 3209-C, 3209-D(5), and 3209-E, and enacts a new section (§3209-F) that explicitly prohibits the PUC from requiring utilities to offer NEB. The definition of distributed generation resources is also revised, narrowing eligibility and removing references to NEB participation. 

Additionally, the bill amends property tax statutes (36 MRSA §§655 and 656) to restrict tax exemptions for solar energy equipment solely to systems where all generated energy is used on-site, removing exemptions for equipment associated with NEB customers or those transmitting energy through utility infrastructure for bill credits. The bill also repeals a sales tax exemption for certain renewable energy equipment (36 MRSA §1760, sub-§80). Other statutory references to NEB are updated or removed to align with the repeal, including changes to eligibility criteria for certain energy projects and assistance programs. 

No specific funding allocations or financial figures are included in the bill, as its primary focus is regulatory repeal and statutory amendment. The bill does not set forth new deadlines or transition periods for existing NEB participants, but by repealing the enabling statutes and prohibiting future NEB requirements, it effectively ends the program upon enactment. 

The key point of this legislation is the comprehensive dismantling of Maine’s net energy billing framework, which has been a significant policy tool for promoting distributed renewable energy generation, particularly solar. By removing NEB, the bill may impact the financial viability of new and existing distributed generation projects and alter incentives for residential, commercial, and institutional customers to invest in renewable energy systems. The bill also narrows property and sales tax benefits for solar installations, further reducing state-level support for distributed renewable energy. 

For organizations focused on advancing renewable energy, distributed generation, and customer energy choice, this bill represents a significant policy shift away from supporting small-scale, customer-owned renewable energy projects.

"L.D. 175 (H.P. 108): RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Ensure That Only Citizens of the United States May Participate in Elections",Oppose,Elections,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Ought Not To Pass Pursuant To Joint Rule 310,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0108?legislature=132,"Legislative Document No. 175, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature, proposes a constitutional amendment to explicitly state that only United States citizens who are at least 18 years old and residents of Maine are eligible to vote in state and local elections, including for Governor, Senators, and Representatives. The amendment modifies Article II, Section 1 of the Maine Constitution by clarifying that voting rights are restricted to U.S. citizens, thereby excluding non-citizens from participating in any elections within the state. The resolution maintains existing exceptions, such as disqualifying individuals under guardianship for reasons of mental illness, and preserves provisions regarding military service members, students, and Native Americans residing on tribal reservations. The proposed amendment will be presented to Maine voters in a statewide referendum during the November election following the resolution's passage, with the Secretary of State responsible for preparing and distributing the necessary ballots and materials. If a majority of voters approve the amendment, it will become part of the Maine Constitution upon the Governor's proclamation. This measure aligns with efforts to clarify and reinforce citizenship requirements for voting eligibility in Maine.",ME Rep. Laurel Libby (R-ME-090),
L.D. 118 (S.P. 21): An Act to Allow Candidates for Sheriff and District Attorney to Participate in the Maine Clean Election Act,Support,Elections,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Ought Not To Pass Pursuant To Joint Rule 310,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/SP0021?legislature=132,"This legislative act amends the Maine Clean Election Act to extend eligibility for public campaign financing to candidates running for the offices of sheriff and district attorney, beginning with the 2028 election cycle. The bill modifies several sections of Title 21-A, Chapter 14 of the Maine Revised Statutes by adding 'sheriff' and 'district attorney' to the list of offices eligible for Clean Election certification, participation, and funding, alongside the existing offices of Governor, State Senator, and State Representative. The legislation directs the Maine Ethics Commission to establish specific terms of participation for sheriff and district attorney candidates, including setting seed money contribution limits, the number of qualifying contributions required, the amount and timing of public fund distributions, and other relevant criteria. In developing these terms, the Commission is instructed to consider factors such as the population and geographic area of counties and prosecutorial districts, historical campaign spending, and the competitiveness of past races, allowing for differentiated rules as appropriate. The bill also updates timelines and procedures for certification, distribution of funds, and compliance requirements to include these new candidate categories. No specific funding amounts are set in the bill; instead, the Commission is tasked with determining appropriate distribution levels and adjusting them periodically based on the Consumer Price Index and other considerations. The act aligns with efforts to expand access to publicly financed, transparent, and equitable campaign options for a broader range of local offices, supporting the organization's mission to promote fair and open elections.",ME Sen.

L.D. 92 (H.P. 57): An Act Regarding the Management of the Waste Components of a Solar Energy Development upon Decommissioning,Watching,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Accepted Majority (Ontp) Report,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0057?legislature=132,"This legislative amendment to Maine's solar energy decommissioning laws revises the requirements for managing waste components generated when a solar energy development is decommissioned. The amendment specifically updates 35-A MRSA §3491, sub-§1, to clarify that decommissioning must now include not only the recycling and disposal of waste components, such as solar panels, but also their proper storage. The storage requirements are differentiated based on whether the waste contains hazardous materials: non-hazardous waste must be managed and stored according to solid waste regulations, while hazardous waste must comply with hazardous waste management laws. The amendment removes the emergency preamble and clause from the original bill, indicating that the changes will proceed through the standard legislative process rather than being expedited. No specific funding allocations or deadlines are mentioned in the text, and the amendment does not introduce new financial obligations but rather clarifies and strengthens regulatory compliance for waste management at the end of a solar facility's life cycle. This change aligns with environmental protection goals by ensuring that waste from decommissioned solar projects is handled in a manner that minimizes environmental risks and complies with existing waste management standards.",ME Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-ME-053),
L.D. 56 (H.P. 20): An Act to Remove the 5 Cent Fee for Bags in Retail Stores,Oppose,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Accepted Majority (Ontp) Report,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0020?legislature=132,"This emergency legislation, introduced in the 132nd Maine Legislature as Legislative Document No. 56, seeks to eliminate the existing 5-cent fee that consumers are required to pay when receiving recycled paper bags or reusable plastic bags at retail establishments. The bill amends Section 1611, subsection 3 of Title 38 of the Maine Revised Statutes, removing the mandate for retailers to charge this fee and striking related provisions, including exemptions for certain stores, restaurants, and hunger relief organizations. The stated rationale for the emergency status is to provide immediate economic relief to Maine residents by removing the financial burden of the bag fee, allowing the law to take effect as soon as it is approved rather than after the standard 90-day waiting period. The legislation does not introduce new funding allocations or financial mechanisms, nor does it impose new requirements on retailers regarding bag distribution, but rather eliminates the existing statutory fee structure. This change aligns with efforts to reduce direct consumer costs at the point of sale, though it may have implications for environmental policy and waste reduction initiatives previously supported by the bag fee.",ME Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-ME-053),
L.D. 75 (H.P. 39): An Act to Update Funding for the Board of Environmental Protection,Support,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Ought Not To Pass Pursuant To Joint Rule 310,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0039?legislature=132,"This legislative act proposes an amendment to 38 MRSA §341-G, which governs the funding of the Board of Environmental Protection in Maine. The primary change introduced by the bill is an increase in the annual cap on funds that may be transferred to the Board of Environmental Protection Fund, raising the limit from $325,000 to $450,000. These funds are sourced from the Maine Environmental Protection Fund, the Maine Ground and Surface Waters Clean-up and Response Fund, the Maine Hazardous Waste Fund, and the Uncontrolled Sites Fund. The Board of Environmental Protection Fund remains a nonlapsing fund, and expenditures from it must continue to be made in accordance with allocations approved by the Legislature. No new deadlines or timelines are introduced by this bill. The key point of this legislation is to provide the Board of Environmental Protection with increased financial resources to support its statutory duties, which aligns with the mission of organizations focused on environmental protection, regulatory oversight, and the effective management of environmental hazards and clean-up efforts in Maine.","ME Rep.

"L.D. 69 (H.P. 33): An Act to Repeal the Law Restricting the Use of Certain Plastic, Paper and Single-use Bags",Oppose,,Introduced or Prefiled,,Final Disposition: Accepted Majority (Ontp) Report,https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/HP0033?legislature=132,"This legislative text proposes the full repeal of Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, Section 1611, which currently restricts the use of recycled paper bags, reusable plastic bags, and single-use carry-out bags. By repealing this statute, the bill would eliminate existing regulations that limit the distribution and use of these types of bags by retailers and other businesses. The bill does not allocate any funding or specify new regulatory measures to replace the repealed law. No specific implementation deadlines or transition periods are mentioned in the text. The primary impact of this legislation is the removal of environmental regulations aimed at reducing single-use and plastic bag waste, which may affect efforts to minimize plastic pollution and promote sustainable alternatives. This change is directly relevant to organizations focused on environmental protection, waste reduction, and sustainable materials management, as it represents a significant shift away from current policies designed to limit single-use plastics and encourage reusable options.",ME Rep.
