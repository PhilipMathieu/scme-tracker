Additionally, the legislation allows the PUC to establish various contract lengths and terms for standard-offer service, further supporting the goal of achieving competitive pricing for consumers. The bill does not specify any new funding allocations or financial figures, nor does it introduce specific timelines or deadlines for implementation.","ME Rep. Walter ""Gerry"" Runte (D-ME-146)",

This amendment explicitly excludes individuals under guardianship due to mental illness from voting. The resolution also maintains that military personnel stationed in the state do not gain residency for voting purposes, nor do students residing at educational institutions. However, it ensures that individuals do not lose their residency status due to military service outside the state. Additionally, the amendment affirms that Native Americans residing on tribal reservations, who meet other qualifications, retain their right to vote in all county, state, and national elections. The resolution outlines a procedure for a statewide referendum to be held in November following the resolution's passage, where voters will decide on the ratification of this constitutional amendment. The Secretary of State is tasked with preparing and distributing the necessary ballots and materials to facilitate this referendum. If a majority of votes favor the amendment, the Governor will proclaim its adoption, and it will become part of the state constitution on the proclamation date.",ME Rep. Laurel Libby (R-ME-090),

The primary objective of these amendments is to extend the benefits of the Maine Clean Election Act, which provides an alternative campaign financing option, to these additional offices. The legislation modifies existing statutes by including sheriffs and district attorneys alongside governors, state senators, and state representatives as eligible participants. This change is reflected in various sections of the Maine Revised Statutes Annotated (MRSA), specifically in sections 1122, 1123, 1124, and 1125, among others. The amendments also establish a qualifying period for these candidates, which begins on January 1st of the election year and ends on April 20th. The Maine Clean Election Fund, a special, dedicated, nonlapsing fund, will finance the election campaigns of certified candidates for these positions, as well as cover administrative and enforcement costs. The commission responsible for administering the Act is tasked with setting terms of participation for sheriff and district attorney candidates, considering factors such as historical spending patterns, population, and competitiveness of races.

Specifically, it amends existing statutes to ensure that areas located on airport properties are not subject to special management considerations or protection guidelines typically required for habitats of species designated as endangered or threatened. This exemption is reflected in amendments to several sections of the Maine Revised Statutes Annotated (MRSA). Firstly, a new subsection is added to 12 MRSA §12804, which explicitly states that the Commissioner cannot identify or develop protection guidelines for endangered or threatened species habitats on airport properties. Additionally, 12 MRSA §12806 is amended to exclude airport projects from restrictions that prevent state agencies or municipal governments from permitting, licensing, funding, or carrying out projects that could significantly alter such habitats. Furthermore, 38 MRSA §480-B is modified to exclude airport activities or developments from requiring approval based on their impact on endangered or threatened species habitats. These legislative changes collectively aim to facilitate airport operations and development by removing the regulatory burden associated with habitat protection for endangered and threatened species on airport properties.",ME Sen.

The primary provision mandates that upon decommissioning, the waste components of a solar energy development must be recycled or disposed of at an authorized facility within 90 days of their physical removal. This requirement is introduced as an amendment to the existing statute, 35-A MRSA §3491, sub-§1, which previously did not specify a timeline for the recycling or disposal process. The legislation is deemed an emergency measure, necessitating immediate implementation to address the rapid increase in solar energy developments and ensure the timely and proper management of waste components.

This change is intended to alleviate the economic burden on Maine residents by removing the mandatory charge that retailers previously had to collect and retain for any lawful purpose. The legislation amends Section 38 MRSA §1611, sub-§3, by removing the requirement for retail establishments to charge this fee, as well as the associated provisions that prohibited rebates or reimbursements of the fee to customers. Additionally, the bill eliminates exemptions that previously allowed certain stores, restaurants, and hunger relief organizations to forgo charging the fee.

The primary objective of this amendment is to update the criteria used to identify coastal wetlands, which are crucial for environmental protection and management. The revised definition includes all tidal and subtidal lands, areas with saltwater-tolerant vegetation primarily found in saltwater or estuarine habitats, and any contiguous lowland such as swamps, marshes, bogs, beaches, or flats that are subject to tidal action during the highest astronomical tide. This determination of the highest astronomical tide is now to be made by the United States Department of Commerce, specifically the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, rather than relying on tide tables published for the year in which an activity is proposed. This change aims to provide a more standardized and reliable method for identifying coastal wetlands, which may also encompass portions of coastal sand dunes.

These credits represent one metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions avoided, removed, or absorbed due to forest management activities. The legislation introduces several new definitions and reporting requirements into the existing Maine Revised Statutes Annotated (MRSA) §8881 and §8885. Specifically, it requires detailed reporting of various aspects of forest carbon projects, including the project's name, the developer, the landowner, registration dates, acreage involved, and any conservation easements. Reports must be submitted within 60 days of the registration or sale of credits, with an initial report fee of $200 for projects over 1,000 acres. The legislation also sets a deadline of July 1, 2026, for reporting on credits registered or sold before the effective date of the new requirements. Additionally, the Director of the Bureau of Forestry is authorized to request further information as needed and to maintain a permanent record of these transactions.

The funds are sourced from several existing environmental funds, including the Maine Environmental Protection Fund, the Maine Ground and Surface Waters Clean-up and Response Fund, the Maine Hazardous Waste Fund, and the Uncontrolled Sites Fund. The legislation specifies that the money in the Board of Environmental Protection Fund is to be used in accordance with allocations approved by the Legislature, ensuring that expenditures align with legislative oversight. This change is reflected in the amendment to 38 MRSA §341-G, which establishes the Board of Environmental Protection Fund as a nonlapsing fund, thereby allowing for the accumulation and use of funds beyond a single fiscal year.","ME Rep.
